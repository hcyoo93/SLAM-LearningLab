In this project, we have developed a LI-EKF for drone localization in MATLAB and C++, taking in IMU measurement for prediction and GPS data for an update. The estimation is verified with self-generated simulated data and Zurich Urban Dataset. EKF algorithm is implemented as a baseline. For the simulated data, the LI-EKF has outperformed EKF in both tracking and boundness of variance; however, the performance of the filters are similar for the Zurich Urban Dataset, since the estimation are following GPS mostly due to the corruption of IMU data. In the future, the LI-EKF might be tested with the inclusion of more sensors or switch to another Dataset.
