In this project we derive and implement a Left-Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (LI-EKF) for quadrotor localization in MATLAB and C++. We applied our filter to simulated data that we generated and also to the Zurich Urban Micro Aerial Vehicle Dataset Dataset \cite{majdik2017zurich}. The filter takes in IMU data for prediction and GPS data for correction. A traditional EKF is implemented as a baseline for comparison. For the simulated data, the tracking of the left-invariant EKF is accurate and has outperformed that of the tradition EKF in both orientation and position. It also achieved decent tracking result with Zurich Urban Dataset, though the estimation is highly dependent on GPS.
