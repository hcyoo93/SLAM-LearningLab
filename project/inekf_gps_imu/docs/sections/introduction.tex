The process model of a 6 degree of freedom vehicle is nonlinear, and there is no general method to design a globally stable observer.  Historically, methods have relied on linearizing the process model by using first order approximations (EKF) or performing an unscented transform (UKF)\cite{thrun2005probabilistic}.  These methods are practical for applications that operate in a small region where linear approximations are valid, but for aerial vehicles undergoing large rotations there is a limited envelope for which they are effective.  Therefore, in order to provide an accurate state estimation over the full flight envelope, we seek an observe that is capable of handling such maneuvers without relying on the traditional techniques. 

For nonlinear process that are group affine, it is possible to design an invariant observer with guaranteed global convergence\cite{InEKF_Barrau}. In this paper, we present an Invariant EKF that uses an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a gyroscope for prediction and GPS for an update. This filter measures the full state of the rigid body, including the position, velocity, and orientation. The filter is tested using simulated data we generated and the Zurich Urban Dataset.
