In addition to the Matlab scripts, we provide a C++ implementation of the filter that is capable of running on a real system.  The implementation uses the Eigen library, which is a header only library for linear algebra.  Dependency and build information is listed on our Github\footnote{\href{https://github.com/ghaggin/invariant-ekf}{https://github.com/ghaggin/invariant-ekf}}, along with usage instructions.

We verify the correctness of this implementation using an extensive testing suite.  Aside from simple checks on assumptions and basic input output, we compare the output of the filter in a number of conditions against the Matlab implementation.  For each of these test, we generate a combination of IMU and GPS measurements, and create an expected output from our Matlab filter.  Then, we run the C++ filter and compare the output to what was generated in Matlab.

We also provide an example driver for the Zurich urban dataset, where red-black trees are used to order asynchronous measurements.
